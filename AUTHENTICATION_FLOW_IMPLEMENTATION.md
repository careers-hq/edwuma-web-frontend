# Authentication Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the protected job application flow with authentication checks and redirects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Header with User Authentication** 
**File:** `/components/layout/Header.tsx`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Header now displays user information when logged in
- ✅ Shows user initials in a circular avatar
- ✅ Displays user's full name from `getUserDisplayName()`
- ✅ Dropdown menu with:
  - Dashboard link
  - Profile Settings
  - My Applications
  - Saved Jobs
  - Logout button
- ✅ Mobile-responsive with different UI for authenticated users
- ✅ Shows Login/Sign Up buttons when not authenticated

#### Key Features:
- User avatar with initials (e.g., "JD" for John Doe)
- Click-outside to close dropdown functionality
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Logout functionality that redirects to home page

---

### 2. **Protected Job Application Utility**
**File:** `/lib/utils/jobApplication.ts`

#### Functions Created:

```typescript
// Store job URL for redirect after login
storeIntendedJobUrl(jobUrl: string): void

// Get and clear stored job URL
getAndClearIntendedJobUrl(): string | null

// Clear stored job URL
clearIntendedJobUrl(): void

// Handle job application with auth check
handleJobApplication(jobUrl: string, isAuthenticated: boolean, loginPath?: string): void

// Process redirect after successful login
processPostLoginRedirect(defaultUrl?: string): {
  shouldRedirectToJob: boolean;
  jobUrl: string | null;
  dashboardUrl: string;
}
```

#### How It Works:
1. Uses `sessionStorage` to temporarily store the job application URL
2. When user clicks "Apply Now" without being authenticated:
   - Stores the job URL in sessionStorage
   - Redirects to login page
3. After successful login:
   - Retrieves and clears the stored job URL
   - Opens job application in new tab
   - Redirects user to dashboard

---

### 3. **Updated Job Detail Page**
**File:** `/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Imports `useAuth` hook to check authentication status
- ✅ Imports `handleJobApplication` utility
- ✅ Created `handleApplyClick` function that:
  - Prevents default link behavior
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - If authenticated: opens job URL in new tab
  - If not authenticated: stores job URL and redirects to login
- ✅ Updated both "Apply Now" buttons to use the new click handler
- ✅ Changed from `<Link>` to `<Button>` with `onClick` handler

#### User Flow:
1. **Authenticated User:**
   - Clicks "Apply Now"
   - Job application URL opens in new tab immediately

2. **Unauthenticated User:**
   - Clicks "Apply Now"
   - Job URL is stored in sessionStorage
   - Redirected to `/auth/login`
   - After successful login, job URL opens in new tab
   - User is redirected to dashboard

---

### 4. **Updated Login Page**
**File:** `/app/auth/login/page.tsx`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Imports `processPostLoginRedirect` utility
- ✅ Enhanced `useEffect` to handle redirect after authentication
- ✅ Enhanced `handleSubmit` to process job application redirect
- ✅ Opens stored job URL in new tab after successful login
- ✅ Then redirects to dashboard

#### Login Flow:
1. User lands on login page (with or without stored job URL)
2. User enters credentials and submits
3. After successful authentication:
   - Check for stored job URL
   - If job URL exists:
     - Open job URL in new tab
     - Redirect to dashboard
   - If no job URL:
     - Redirect to dashboard

## Authentication Flow Diagram

### For Unauthenticated Users:
```
User clicks "Apply Now" on Job Detail Page
    ↓
Check if authenticated (useAuth)
    ↓
NOT AUTHENTICATED
    ↓
Store job URL in sessionStorage
    ↓
Redirect to /auth/login
    ↓
User logs in successfully
    ↓
Retrieve stored job URL
    ↓
Open job URL in new tab
    ↓
Clear stored URL from sessionStorage
    ↓
Redirect to /dashboard
```

### For Authenticated Users:
```
User clicks "Apply Now" on Job Detail Page
    ↓
Check if authenticated (useAuth)
    ↓
AUTHENTICATED
    ↓
Open job URL in new tab
    ↓
User remains on current page
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session Storage Strategy
- **Why sessionStorage?** 
  - Data persists only for the current browser session
  - Automatically cleared when browser tab is closed
  - More secure than localStorage for temporary redirects
  - No conflicts with other tabs

### Key: `edwuma_redirect_after_login`

### Security Considerations
- ✅ URL is stored client-side only (no server exposure)
- ✅ URL is cleared immediately after use
- ✅ Uses `noopener,noreferrer` when opening external links
- ✅ Authentication state is managed by AuthContext

## Testing Checklist

### Scenario 1: Authenticated User Applies
- [ ] User is logged in
- [ ] User navigates to job detail page
- [ ] User clicks "Apply Now"
- [ ] Job application URL opens in new tab
- [ ] User remains on job detail page

### Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User Applies
- [ ] User is not logged in
- [ ] User navigates to job detail page
- [ ] User clicks "Apply Now"
- [ ] User is redirected to login page
- [ ] After login, job application URL opens in new tab
- [ ] User is redirected to dashboard
- [ ] Job URL is cleared from sessionStorage

### Scenario 3: Direct Login (No Job Application)
- [ ] User navigates directly to login page
- [ ] User logs in successfully
- [ ] User is redirected to dashboard
- [ ] No job URL opens

### Scenario 4: Header Behavior
- [ ] When logged out: Shows "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons
- [ ] When logged in: Shows user avatar with initials
- [ ] When logged in: Shows user's full name
- [ ] Dropdown menu opens on click
- [ ] Dropdown menu closes when clicking outside
- [ ] Logout button logs user out and redirects to home

## Files Modified

1. `/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Dynamic header with auth state
2. `/lib/utils/jobApplication.ts` - Job application utilities (NEW)
3. `/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Protected job application flow
4. `/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Redirect handling after login

---

## Environment Variables
No new environment variables required.

---

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing:
- `@/lib/auth` - AuthContext and hooks
- `next/navigation` - Router and navigation
- React state management

---

## Future Enhancements
1. Track job applications in database (requires backend API)
2. Show "Already Applied" status on jobs
3. Add application history to user dashboard
4. Email notifications for job applications
5. Resume upload during application process
6. Application tracking and status updates

---

## Notes for Dashboard
The dashboard already:
- ✅ Shows user's name using `getUserDisplayName()`
- ✅ Is protected by `ProtectedRoute` component
- ✅ Displays user information correctly
- ✅ Has logout functionality

No additional changes needed for dashboard as it already meets the requirements.
