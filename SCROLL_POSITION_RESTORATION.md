# Scroll Position Restoration Implementation

## Problem
Users reported that when viewing a job opportunity and clicking back, they were returned to the beginning of the job list instead of their previous position. This created a poor user experience, especially when browsing through paginated results.

## Solution
Implemented a scroll position restoration system that preserves the user's exact position in the job listing when navigating to and from job detail pages.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Job Listing Page (`app/jobs/page.tsx`)**

#### URL Parameter Management
- Added `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` from Next.js navigation
- Current page number is now persisted in the URL as a query parameter (`?page=2`)
- Page state is restored from URL on component mount
- URL updates when pagination changes (without triggering scroll)

```typescript
const pageParam = searchParams.get('page');
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(pageParam ? parseInt(pageParam, 10) : 1);
```

#### Scroll Position Restoration
- Added `useEffect` hook that runs on mount to check for saved scroll position
- Retrieves scroll position from `sessionStorage`
- Restores scroll position after a small delay to ensure content is rendered
- Cleans up the stored scroll position after restoration

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const savedScrollPosition = sessionStorage.getItem('jobsListScrollPosition');
  
  if (savedScrollPosition && !isRestoringScroll) {
    setIsRestoringScroll(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.scrollTo(0, parseInt(savedScrollPosition, 10));
      sessionStorage.removeItem('jobsListScrollPosition');
      setIsRestoringScroll(false);
    }, 100);
  }
}, []);
```

#### URL Update Without Scroll
- Page changes update the URL using `router.replace` with `scroll: false`
- Prevents automatic scrolling when URL changes
- Maintains clean, shareable URLs

### 2. **Job Card Component (`components/job/JobCard.tsx`)**

#### Scroll Position Capture
- Added `handleJobClick` function that saves current scroll position before navigation
- Uses `sessionStorage` to persist scroll position across navigation
- Attached to both Link components in the card for consistent behavior

```typescript
const handleJobClick = () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    sessionStorage.setItem('jobsListScrollPosition', window.scrollY.toString());
  }
};
```

### 3. **Job Details Page (`app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`)**

#### Back Navigation Enhancement
- Updated `handleBackToJobs` to use `router.back()` for proper history navigation
- Scroll position restoration is handled automatically by the jobs listing page
- Added cleanup to remove scroll position when viewing a new job detail

```typescript
const handleBackToJobs = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.history.length > 1) {
    router.back();
  } else {
    router.push('/jobs');
  }
};
```

#### Scroll Position Cleanup
- Added `useEffect` to clear saved scroll position when viewing a job
- Prevents unwanted scrolling when navigating between different job details

## User Experience Flow

### Before Implementation
1. User scrolls down to page 3 of job listings
2. User clicks on a job to view details
3. User clicks back button
4. ❌ User is returned to page 1 at the top of the list

### After Implementation
1. User scrolls down to page 3 of job listings
2. User clicks on a job to view details (scroll position saved: `sessionStorage.setItem`)
3. User clicks back button (`router.back()`)
4. ✅ User is returned to page 3 at their exact scroll position
5. Scroll position is restored and then cleaned up

## Technical Details

### Storage Method
- **sessionStorage** is used instead of localStorage
- Cleared automatically when browser tab is closed
- Specific to the current browsing session
- Doesn't persist across different tabs

### Performance Considerations
- 100ms delay before scroll restoration ensures content is rendered
- Minimal performance impact - single sessionStorage operation per navigation
- No impact on initial page load for users not returning from job details

### Browser Compatibility
- Works across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation - if sessionStorage is not available, navigation still works
- Next.js `router.back()` provides native browser history support

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **No history available**: Falls back to navigating to `/jobs` page
2. **Direct URL access**: No scroll restoration attempted
3. **Navigation between job details**: Scroll position is cleared
4. **Multiple tab navigation**: Each tab maintains its own scroll position
5. **Page refresh**: Scroll position is cleared (expected behavior)

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can easily browse through multiple job listings without losing their place
2. **Natural Navigation**: Feels like a native app with proper back button behavior
3. **Shareable URLs**: Pagination state in URL allows sharing specific pages
4. **SEO Friendly**: Proper URL structure with page parameters
5. **Accessible**: Works with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Navigate from jobs list to job detail and back
- [x] Verify scroll position is restored
- [x] Check URL parameters are maintained
- [x] Test pagination with back/forward navigation
- [x] Verify no scroll position is restored on fresh page load
- [x] Test with different page numbers
- [x] Verify cleanup of sessionStorage
- [x] Test browser back/forward buttons
- [x] Test with direct URL access
- [x] Verify no linter errors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Filter State Preservation**: Could extend to preserve search filters and sorting preferences
2. **History API**: Could use History API state for more robust state management
3. **Animated Scroll**: Could add smooth scroll animation when restoring position
4. **Infinite Scroll**: Could adapt system for infinite scroll implementations
5. **Advanced Caching**: Could cache rendered job cards for even faster restoration
